# Wall Climbing Robot
Controls a robot that can drive on walls using a propeller.

**main.py** - Has driving tests, propeller tests, a control mode using a Playstation 4 controller, and a controller test mode. 

**462demo.py** - Just the control mode. Specify 'arm' when running the script if you want to arm the propeller.

**esc_TEST.py** - The original Python 2 version of esc_TEST.py is from [AGTx](https://www.instructables.com/Driving-an-ESCBrushless-Motor-Using-Raspberry-Pi/). It helped me test the ESC and write code to control the ESC.
